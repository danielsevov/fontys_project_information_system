## Sales Manager

As a sales manager I make sure all business processes are smooth and optimal. I have analytical, organizational, supervisial and managerial functions. I am the one who controls the performance of the company and of it's sales officers and employees. I need to make sure that the clients are satisfied with thier travel experience and that the business is not underperforming or making unrequired losses.

- Therefore, I want to see different statistics regarding flights, airports and travelling routes to help me analyze the company’s performance.
- I would like to be able to see the status of upcoming flights, such as the aircraft occupancy(percentage of sold and empty seats), travel information concerning departure and arrival times, as well as delays and early arrivals.
- I want to be able to browse airports and their statistics. Travel routes should also be browsable and the details regarding them, such as travel restrictions, lenght of flight, etc. should be visible as well.
- I want to see KPI’s such as customer satisfaction, the current customer retention (how many and how often the same customers come back to use our services again), and the referral rate of our services (how many new travelers we have gained through our current travelers). 
- I want to have an overview of the performance in terms of revenue, sales and popularity to make sure the company is not struggling financially. 
- I want to be able to see officers and employees profiles with statistics of their performance. I want to be able to see all details about the flights organized by a officer and the bookings made by an employee. Customer's profiles should also be acceccible to me to check their travel details and booking history.

## Sales Employee

As an employee I am the connection between customers and the company itself. I am the one responsible for organizing the bookings of the customers, to plan their trips and to arrange their tickets. I am the one who affects the opinion of the customers the most and so I should be able to meet their needs and requirements by presenting them with a wide selections of travelling posibilities.

- Therefore, I should have the possibility to look up available flights and to create, edit and delete bookings for one or more travelers. 
- I should be able to assign tickets to customers and to make suggestions for paid extras to the customers and attatch them together with a seat to their ticket. I want to organize multiple tickets into trips and multiple trips into bookings so I can easily see all details about a certain booking and to modify only what I need to modify.
- I should be able to see information regarding flight capacity and occupancy, prices and discounts, travel restrictions for particular routes, airport details as well as the travelers’ information and booking history.
- I should be able to look up flights by travelling routes or by airports so I can easily plan trips and bookings.

## Sales Officer

As a sales officer, I am the one organizing and maintaining all flights. I make sure that all flights are planned properly based on travel restrictions, airplane and airport capacity and route popularity. I keep track of the flights status and edit or cancel flights based on the needs.

- That is why I want the ability to register, edit and cancel upcoming flights in the system.
- I want to set the prices for the flights and adjust them in order to provide temporary or permanent discounts.
- I want to see details about airports such as airplane capacity and parking space availability, costs, working hours, weather conditions and special services.
- I want to see the status of travelling routes, regarding travel restrictions, meteorological conditions or other potential safety threats.
